@misc{BVF10,
	abstract = {We present a tutorial on Bayesian optimization, a method of finding the maximum of expensive cost functions. Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments---active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning---and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences. },

@book{LC03,
	abstract = {This is a book for those who want to understand the main ideas in the theory of optimal problems. It provides a good introduction to classical topics (under the heading of ``the calculus of variations'') and more modern topics (under the heading of ``optimal control''). It employs the language and terminology of functional analysis to discuss and justify the setup of problems that are of great importance in applications. The book is concise and self-contained, and should be suitable for readers with a standard undergraduate background in engineering mathematics.},
